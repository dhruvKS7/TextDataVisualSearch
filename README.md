# TextData Visual Search

This repository contains the code for my visual search feature for the TextData website along with the proposal and final reports. The code in this repository is solely meant to highlight my individual contributions to the TextData website and does not function in isolation. For a complete view of how my code fits into TextData, please view the official TextData repository.

The final report contains all of the details regarding implementation. Alternatively, the following YouTube video offers an overview of the project along with a real-time demonstration of its use: https://youtu.be/nUlfqc595mQ
