# TextData Visual Search

This repository contains the code for my visual search feature for the TextData website along with the proposal and final reports. The code in this repository is solely meant to highlight my individual contributions to the TextData website and does not function in isolation. For a complete view of how my code fits into TextData, please view the official TextData repository. Before this feature can successfully be used and interacted with, it needs to be officially pushed to production for TextData, which is not specifically under my control. In order to see a demonstration of the feature being used, please consult the video below. The provided report contains screenshots of the finalized UI as well.

The final report contains all of the details regarding implementation. Alternatively, the following YouTube video offers an overview of the project along with a real-time demonstration of its use: https://youtu.be/nUlfqc595mQ

**Note:** The UI presented in the video above was an early iteration and is not fully representative of the current UI. For a detailed look at the finalized frontend, please look at the relevant figures in the report.
